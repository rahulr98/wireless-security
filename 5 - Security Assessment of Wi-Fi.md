# 1. Learn the basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it. #

   - Wi-Fi, short for Wireless Fidelity, is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to communicate with each other without the use of physical cables. Wi-Fi uses radio waves to transmit data between devices and access points, which are connected to a wired network.
   - There are several types of Wi-Fi networks, including:
      - **Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN):**  WPAN is a short-range wireless network that typically covers a range of a few meters. Examples of WPAN technologies include Bluetooth and Near Field Communication (NFC).
      - **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN):** WLAN is a wireless network that covers a larger area than WPAN, typically up to a few hundred meters. WLAN is commonly used in homes, offices, and public places such as airports, cafes, and libraries.
      - **Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN):**  WMAN is a wireless network that covers a larger area than WLAN, typically several kilometers. Examples of WMAN technologies include WiMAX and LTE.
      - **Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN):**  WWAN is a wireless network that covers a very large area, typically spanning across countries or even continents. Examples of WWAN technologies include cellular networks such as 3G, 4G, and 5G.
   - Despite its convenience, Wi-Fi is susceptible to various types of attacks, including:
      - **Eavesdropping:** Eavesdropping involves intercepting and reading Wi-Fi traffic. This type of attack can be carried out using software such as packet sniffers.
      - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** In a MitM attack, an attacker intercepts Wi-Fi traffic and alters it before forwarding it to its intended destination. This can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information such as login credentials.
      - **Rogue access points:** A rogue access point is an unauthorized Wi-Fi access point that is set up to mimic a legitimate access point. Users who connect to a rogue access point can unwittingly give an attacker access to their sensitive information.
      - **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:** A DoS attack involves overwhelming a Wi-Fi network with traffic to the point that it becomes unavailable to legitimate users.
      - **Password cracking:** Password cracking involves using software to guess a Wi-Fi network's password. This can allow an attacker to gain access to the network and its connected devices.
